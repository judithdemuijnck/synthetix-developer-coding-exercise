known limitations:
summary (no reliable/consistent/uniform answer so not possible to simply concert to plaintext & truncate as summary/preview )
dangerously set inner html: security risks because client-side rendering, no protection in place for executing scripts etc, react doesn't allow this by default, would usually deal with this on server-side
REACT_APP env --> again, client-side rendering, so keys visible, would handle this on sever-side usually

more error handling
more testing
